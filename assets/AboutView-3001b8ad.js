I am currently a second year student in Media & Information Design at LUCA School of Arts in Brussels. I have always had an interest for graphic design in its larger form and went to a parttime art academy since I was a child. The year before starting my higher eductaion I took evening classes in graphic design & illustration to get a base before starting to study and be able to build a strong portfolio for the entrace exam. In my free time I likes to experiment with different materials to design en visualise elements. I also have a passion for photography, printmaking and literature. In my work I try to combine both the analog and digital aspect of graphic design and experiment with design in 3D.
